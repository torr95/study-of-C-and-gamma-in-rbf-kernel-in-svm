There are three mainly parameters in support vector machine which are:
1.kernel
2.C
3.gamma
>using a terrain example i have plotted graph of bumpiness and grade on x and y axis respectively to show whether a car can move fast or slow.
>i have used linear kernel and changed the value of C from small to very large to its effect on graph and accuracy.
>i have also used rbf kernel to change value of gamma with constant c=100, for same reason.
